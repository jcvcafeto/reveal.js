I capped the following two BS - Psychology programs for Walden, but it seems we are still getting leads.  We should only be getting BS - Psychology leads for Exclusive.

Can you please verify that these two programs are not being shown on the Select widget?

BS - Psychology: General Psychology
BS - Psychology: Applied Psychology

While this may seem like an odd place for our brand there is actually a large thirst for education content on the site. ASO's pinterest got over 40k impressions last month with about a third of the content that BC has. We are hoping this can become a great new source of traffic for BC. 

To verify our website’s authenticity we need to claim the BC website. When done, our profile picture will show up next to any Pins that come from our site, and a small globe icon will appear to the left of our website’s URL on our profile. Truly, these just gives our Pinterest Profile more authority and shows we are indeed connected to the BC site.

In order to ""claim"" our website on Pinterest and prove that we are the owners of the site, we need to add the following HTML tag to BestColleges.com. 

*Below you will find the instructions:*

Paste this tag into the <head> section of your site’s index.html file

In short, there's no technical issue here.  DE is calculated as it was configured to do so, and showing the school/product combos in calculated eRPV order.

What we could improve is how we calculate erpv.  Basically, the bumps don't currently affect the ""ML revenue"" portion of the formula (that accounts for how much downstream revenue we expect to get in the revenue), but only the expected revenue of the initial school.  We will change this in the next few days, but worth noting that this essentially means that this school was still worth showing in this instance for the ML revenue only.   I firmly do not believe we should artificially bump SEL out of Ad positions if the calculated erpv suggests they should be there.  My 2 cents!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello David Rubin ( https://app.asana.com/0/223157124360941/list ) I updated all the emails, except the ones that were being sent directly to Emma already.

Cool - I'll set up a different request for a contact page on OnlineMBAtoday.com. 

I'm not sure about that AOC.org email, but I am fairly confident no one checks it. Could you have those emails go to contact@ instead?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ""unformatted linkout"" under *Featured 2-year Colleges* is another type of monetization called Directory Link and the other one situed under *Featured Programs* are Editorial Links (EL). The EL widget is working as expected, but if you want it to offer another program you or someone will need to change things in MOD.

Let me know if you have another question :)

I saw this and fixed this on a number of posts too. This existed before our MoD updates. The `<script>` tag isn't formed correctly so it's not processing as a script.

It should open like:

<script type=""text/javascript"">// <![CDATA[

And then close like:

// ]]></script>

jvalencia@highereducation.com ( https://app.asana.com/0/933532928622344/list ), is this something you can check around the site for and fix as you find them?

Hi Eric Rasch ( https://app.asana.com/0/221958638007097/list ).
I fixed this issue by i can't make the deployment of this site. Could you help us please with it?
It was about of removing text from 2 <a> tags.

Repo: https://github.com/HigherEducation/OEDb.org","01/Mar/19 9:27 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Jen G commented:_{color}

Hi! 

I don't think this is the proper way to complete this task (and honestly, I'm not sure why this is a task at all).

But since it is a task, the proper way to do this would be to set overflow: hidden on the two <a> tags, not remove the text altogether.

jvalencia@highereducation.com ( https://app.asana.com/0/933532928622344/list ), would you please restore the text in these <a> tags so we don't not have empty anchors on the homepage, (you could revert  https://github.com/HigherEducation/OEDb.org/commit/6df4701b210a44e8bebee55073da53cc4492aeae).

Then, would you please create a branch from master. In that branch, find and commit style changes to the two items in the stylesheets, setting the `overflow: hidden` styles. Start a Pull Request (PR) and please assign that PR to me, and I'll compile the styles and set up a staging site. Then we'll put this through the PR approval process.

Thanks!

Hi, the attachment contains a spreadsheet with the new URLs that will replace the broken ones.
I really tried and investigated how to do the change but i found that this piece of code on WP is the one that is displaying the schools:
[schools_list expand_top=""1"" expand_all=""false"" show_methodology=""false""]","20/Feb/19 1:52 PM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5c36458a1c6a692feab99638;Yes, that's right. I am not sure how/if we can access the database that is pulling this information. I was hoping you might be able to help me investigate?","20/Feb/19 2:13 PM;jvalencia1;[~qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5c36458a1c6a692feab99638] Thank you for your response.
I already escalate this task to the dev team who can help us with the invetigation. :) ","20/Feb/19 2:16 PM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5c36458a1c6a692feab99638;Oh, perfect! Thank you :)","20/Feb/19 4:55 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Eric Rasch commented:_{color}

jvalencia@highereducation.com ( https://app.asana.com/0/933532928622344/list ) I can't access the spreadsheet to even see any of the problem items. Can you put that in Google Drive? 

Julie Linton ( https://app.asana.com/0/774891322319184/list ) Can you give me an example page on OMBA so I can see what data you're talking about?","20/Feb/19 5:00 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Eric Rasch commented:_{color}

Julie Linton ( https://app.asana.com/0/774891322319184/list ) Looks like that WP shortcode is pulling from Google Sheets so you should be able to edit these yourself. 

cc'ing Stephanie Snider ( https://app.asana.com/0/223157124360929/list ) and Amy Tran ( https://app.asana.com/0/223201684503773/list ) for guidance","20/Feb/19 5:00 PM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5c36458a1c6a692feab99638;Sure! An example is on https://www.onlinemba.com/programs-in-oklahoma/ under <h2>Online MBA Programs in Oklahoma. There is a data table with two broken links in the ""Southern Nazarene University"" section.

I was checking the google docs file but it seems i don't have permissions to change anything there.

Do you mean the spreadsheet with the broken links on it that I created? 

I found the Google sheets that are pulling the data into the site and updated the links there already, so I think this task can be resolved. Although I haven't seen the changes I made to the Google sheets on the live site yet. Maybe it takes some time? Maybe there is another step?","22/Feb/19 5:29 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Amy Tran commented:_{color}

Julie Linton ( https://app.asana.com/0/774891322319184/list ) Yes, the final step is to hit ""update"" on the pages themselves! That is what triggers it to reimport the Google Sheet data. If you do that and the changes still aren't coming through after ~an hour, let me know and I'll investigate further! Otherwise, I will close this task out.","26/Feb/19 10:56 AM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5c36458a1c6a692feab99638;Thanks for the update, Amy! I Updated the relevant pages in Wordpress yesterday, but it looks like the links have not updated. Any ideas? Should I try again?

The page URLs that are impacted are here: 
https://www.onlinemba.com/programs-in-oklahoma/
https://www.onlinemba.com/schools/southern-nazarene-university/
https://www.onlinemba.com/rankings/healthcare-administration/

I attached the spreadsheet with the new links that I am trying to insert. 

These are the Google sheets that I have updated with the new links: 
Oklahoma - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uULFhhibUcTKjgmWRNhY1iuLUG7SbOS2YVGj8uHYrbE/edit#gid=1800982647
Southern Nazarene - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sRYgHIFUCqLJlB-HYORp-7uR62tmTU6JI7-0ZRhaN8w/edit#gid=0
Healthcare Admin - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NixgI7-zbFHl_3O5UpU9FC8qac0HGd7L0otXfcSlqTs/edit#gid=0

I think I have completed all the steps, but I am not seeing the new links on the live site yet. I cleared my cache a few times. Let me know what you think. Thanks!

Hi Eric Rasch ( https://app.asana.com/0/221958638007097/list ).

It looks like Herzing needs to update again the information in https://www.hackcollege.com/school-finder/schools/ohio/akron-institute-of-herzing-university/. As this info is in a database, i have to escalate this task.
I'll be on attention if you need more info.

Thanks

Dave@Cafeto ( https://app.asana.com/0/623227981136756/list ) I also added into Jira here: https://highereducation.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/HE-953","12/Feb/19 9:04 PM;syncbot;Adding here: original task mastersinhealthcare.com - Missing Content ( https://app.asana.com/0/490940853584621/1109197743272097 )

We are going to have to escalate this issue, it has been reported before, but it fixes itself after a while.
There is definitely something going on here.

Adding other similar old tasks referring to the absence of content: 
✓ mastersinhealthcare.com - No Directory Links ( https://app.asana.com/0/490940853584621/995675872542244 )

 !image-2019-02-11-16-48-49-373.png|thumbnail! 
As i see, each site (thus the browser) is sending requests to the same resource and downloading what it needs to serve the page. However, there could be different reasons of why this could be happening:
- Your local internet connection (the speed)
- The browser have to download heavy styles and/or images 
- Issues on the domain","11/Feb/19 4:05 PM;jvalencia1;In addition, i've been following the code and it hasn't had big changes since December.

Hi Emily Maddox ( https://app.asana.com/0/106813058990697/list ):

We had a bunch of questions on this site. Please see the description above and also this PR: https://github.com/HigherEducation/OnlineCertificatePrograms.org/pull/3/files.

  1. We have a mix of non-rebranded URLs as well as branded urls. However, none of them seem to be populating ""Programs"" on the form page. So does this mean that all the form URLs on this site need to be updated?
  2. As a follow up to #1, who can help Dave make sure all the correct links are chosen?
  3. We have a ""featured school"" module that lives at the top of many pages on this site (see attached screenshot). We need a generic link to a form (you'll notice in the PR files that a specific link to Medical Billing & Coding was chosen, but I think this is not quite right). The one we currently have on the site - http://certificates.onlinecertificateprograms.org/forms/penn-foster-career-school?publisher=onlinecertificateprogramsorg - isn't working properly. Who can choose this Penn Foster Link?

Thank you, Emily!

But SEL campaigns are also capped at this point and the forms show no programs for users to select. (same for PUG). Ideally users should still be able to select a program for ML purposes.

I assume you are referring to the possibility of adding monetization on the homepage.

Please verify this thank you!


===
Also, If it were possible please add a bit more description to monetization tickets.
For example, if it is to add Directory Links or another widget please state ""Add Directory Links"".
If the widget is not working please add ""Broken Widget"" or something like that.
I believe it would make for a better workflow! Thank you!!","29/Jan/19 8:05 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Offshore Team commented:_{color}

Just wanted to confirm we received the URLs. And after testing for both schools, the pixel appears to be working fine. 
We've tested and are getting 200 when the pixel fires.

Did this happen on any particular site? Did the 304 happen after refreshing? :) please let us know so we can continue testing

These kind of things happen by cache: when leads are being catched too fast, platform takes a time to receive the information in which it knows when a capbucket reached its limit. This task is already notified to the backend team, there're working on that.

One thing to note here is if you see the difference for example at 4:30 and 17:23 for admin and conversion_ledger, we can found the next:
*Admin*
144 - 129 = 15
*c_ledger*
216 - 201 = 15

The differences between these are most the same. However, it's different for normalized events:
315 - 295 = 20.

This behavior can be found in all the table.","29/Jan/19 11:39 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

Just took another look at this one. The reason conversions aren't coming into the normalized_events table (and thus, into QV) is that the school in the linkout doesn't match the school noted on the script on the conversion page.

Linkout URL example: https://platform.highereducation.com/editorial-links/collegechoice.net/5126
The school for this one is ""New England College - School of Graduate Studies"".
The conversion page you eventually land on from that link has ""school=new-england-college"" in the conversion script parameters. It would need to read ""school=new-england-college-school-of-graduate-studies"" for the conversion event to match up with the click event.

TL;DR; The school needs to update the conversion script placed on that page to read ""school=new-england-college-school-of-graduate-studies"".","07/Feb/19 2:43 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave Ashworth commented:_{color}

The issue here was that the affiliate placed the widget sending degree data only.
The MOD rule was expecting the complete DCS, to match it with the rule.
Since it didn't match, it was showing another rule.

So the solution here is:
Ask the affiliate to set the complete DCS.
Or remove completely the degree-data from the placement and set it all via MOD rule.

Liberty's EXCL LP seems* to be delivering a different [lead_id] value to Liberty than what platform events is capturing internally.  The lead data Liberty is reporting back indicates a [lead_id] with 7 characters but platform events presents a [lead_id] with 9 characters.  It would be helpful to understand what id is currently* being passed along and, assuming the assumptions above are correct, update the id passed to the [lead_id] reported in platform events (example output below with 9 character [lead_id]).

We currently do not ingest the _CLICK_ID_ parameter on the Liberty page. So, the `lead_id` reported here will not match up to our data.

I have already sent an email to Will Stern, but its probably best that this is issue is tracked here.

Last week I put a daily cap of 10 for Grand Canyon University but it looks like we have exceeded that daily cap everyday since 1/10.  Even today we have already delivered 22 clicks (see screenshot attached).

Thanks,
Becky

I investigated the issue and did the following:
- Checked the config of the cap on EDU Direct and the Audit option. You say you made a change the last week but it doesn't appear there. The last change was from17 days ago. However i checked the limits cap (see picture) and found that everything is as you showed in the picture.
- Checked leads count with metabase and the numbers match up.
- Made a count of leads from the last 2018-01-01 until today. I put them here:

2019-01-01: 30 leads
2019-01-02: 20 leads
2019-01-03: 30 leads
2019-01-04: 10 leads
2019-01-05: 9 leads
2019-01-06: 8 leads
2019-01-07: 11 leads

For the GCU - UG - Education LO CPC bucket, there is a daily cap of 10. However we delivered 22 leads yesterday.  So far today we have delivered 12 leads and I want to make sure the daily cap is working.

Could we change it to be a block type instead? 

On BC (tag type): https://www.bestcolleges.com/styleguide/#checklist_item

On GoGrad (block type): https://www.gograd.org/styleguide/#checklist

We often have content that needs to be formatted with links and etc. for the checklists (see screenshot 2 for example of content).

Setting to medium urgency because we are currently publishing a lot of BC content and having the checklist work as a block type would help us a lot.

managament information systems is under business.
Contextual defaults grabs the subject and if the subject is there it assumes the category based on that subject. No reason for a second lookup.

I found the geography issue. It wont be fixed until tomorrow though. The issue is we have a static list of degree, category and subjects for the SSR. It is in the actual code. Geography is not in that list. We either need to add it to the list OR pull the list from the database at startup. Originally we just had a static list of the most important ones to keep from loading ALL the items on server render. The problem is when the list gets loaded it is null when it is something we dont have.","10/Jan/19 7:05 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Saul Maddox commented:_{color}

[~mcomardo],"10/Jan/19 8:46 AM;dacosta;Hello Amy, after troubleshooting this issue, we found that the <sidebar-content> is hidden when you update the content using Forestry. This is possibly due to a wrong template being selected. 
We  are going to continue reviewing this issue, we'll update you as soon as possible.","10/Jan/19 9:33 AM;dacosta;Escalating this to Frontend, to review a commit.

So the issue is that on Forestry, the Layout is set to <single> by default. 
And for the ""Related Links"" to show up, the <sidebar> layout has to be chosen when the update is made.
 !ForestryOption.png|thumbnail! 


Please try it out and let us know!","10/Jan/19 10:19 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Jason Comes commented:_{color}

The layout was changed from Sidebar to Single. The only place the Related Links live are in the Sidebar Layout so on change to the single layout this changed it to a template that doesn't have the related links. Changing this back to the sidebar layout fixed the issue.","10/Jan/19 10:24 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Jason Comes commented:_{color}

Its not set to single by default... Its only set to single if it was previously a single template page.","10/Jan/19 11:30 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Amy Tran commented:_{color}

[Jason Comes](https://app.asana.com/0/221880129404897/list) Is this fixed for all pages? We aren't selecting the wrong template when we update the page. When we update the page, the template changes by itself.","10/Jan/19 11:41 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Eric Rasch commented:_{color}

I looked at a page this morning and it had nothing selected, but had 2 choices available. It might be possible it's trying to assign a default if the page is re-saved without anything selected whereas nothing is happening to pages that are not touched.","10/Jan/19 11:54 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Jason Comes commented:_{color}

Might have been a forestry bug or update, because I had the ability to set it up as a default before and now I don't. So the 1st item in the list was the selected as the default. I flipped this and made the sidebar the first layout in the list so it'll be selected as default. This should work correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the *DevTeam *here is what i found:
I checked the pixel on the Elements and Network inspector and found this:

On the Elements inspector: 
 !image-2019-01-09-08-58-47-638.png|thumbnail! 

On the Network inspector: There's a <conversion.js> request but it's for GoogleAdServices.
 !image-2019-01-09-09-02-32-692.png|thumbnail! 

- I changed the VPN location and opened up a incognito window with Google Chrome but no pixel was found on the network inspector. 
- I checked metabase and made a query for normalized_events and conversion_ledger tables from Platform Events DB but didn't find any registry.
- I checked Admin but there's not leads in the CapBuckets.

SNHU is in fact not adding up any way . Currently I'm troubleshooting the issue with Chad.

Currently the differences are visible between all counts.
 8412 for Admin count
 9803 for SNHU School count
 9836 for Metabase (nomalized_events)
10105 for Metabase(conversion_ledger)
10172 for QV (H-E Count)

So The school is closer to the Metabase(normailized_events) count. 

We'll keep an eye on this and update you as soon as possible.

I guess the next links are articles, in those Kaplan is named, i don't know if kaplan needs to be replaced there, i'm unsure because it has to do with content:

Also, there're other links that contain Kaplan URLs, i looked for replaceable URLs from PUG but again, i think this needs to be reviewed. Please refer to this document (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IC-Tw41oRtuuwjrcAoXjsXynH7zTUQQJ/view?usp=sharing)","20/Dec/18 1:03 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Amy Tran commented:_{color}

[jvalencia@highereducation.com](https://app.asana.com/0/933532928622344/list) My team can remove the Kaplan mentions, but if we want Kaplan to be replaced, we will need the content to replace it with since I do not have that. It'd be useful if we could get the URLs in a spreadsheet instead of a PDF -- we do not need screenshots.

So our options are:

1. Remove Kaplan without replacing them. My team can get started on this right away.
2. Replace Kaplan with new content. My team will have to wait for the content team to write replacement content.

I encountered this 404 on (209.20.72.247) and then tried the link on this 2 different proxies (192.237.163.133) (209.20.92.185)","02/Jan/19 8:26 AM;dacosta;Hello team,

Unfortunately I have been unable to replicate this issue.  I am currently on (181.214.63.29) For Chicago,IL and I've tested the different program linkouts and all are working. Also, we are receiving leads from OnlineMBA.
The main page *should* show different DL when it is refreshed. 


This ticekt will serve as precedent if this issue comes up frequently. Thank you for reporting.

* From those 8, 5 of them have different IP. (There's a lead with 2 entries and another one with 3)

Yeah, this looks like a bug to me.  My first thought was: “did the last 4+ leads all come in within an hour?” because caching could potentially cause that to happen and go over by a few.  But that wasn’t the case - we hit 5 at 8:34am and then the overage in the afternoon.","21/Dec/18 10:22 AM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5b48c306b84bc45fea95fb34;Hi Team,

Hey Becky!
We don't have a solution yet - I've marked it as a bug and we'll get it into our workflow.  (adding Emily for an FYI)

What's the urgency of this bug by the way?  I'm definitely marking it as a ""will fix"", but would love to get an idea on the problems it's causing for you guys.","21/Dec/18 11:27 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Becky Depew commented:_{color}

Hi Will,

I just took a look at the number in QV and it seems to be ""fixed"" for now. I am not seeing leads exceed 5/day since 12/16.  It's not necessarily urgent, but we were noticing that Trident was stealing a lot of the Click Volume from Purdue and SNHU. SNHU was pacing behind so we definitely wanted to do anything we can to get them caught up. Make sense?

Thanks,
Becky",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I replace manual LOs with Editorial Links Widget.,"11/Dec/18 9:40 AM;jvalencia1;Hello Emily Maddox, i'm Juan Camilo Valencia from Cafeto and i'll be working in support with David.
For this site (https://www.onlineschools.org/), i wonder if the change i made is what you want. I generated the widget with platform, put 2 links and the CTA color according with the table that was there before. So:
- Are the number of links ok?
- Should i change the title section?
- Is the CTA text right? 

","11/Dec/18 9:45 AM;jvalencia1;Currently exists ACF fields for this site. If the site is going to be transitioned to platform links, should they be removed?

Note to DEV:
Per slack convo with Jen , she stated: ""This site also has the “Higher Education” plugin on it, which adds a “Directory Links” menu item in the sidebar of the WP dashboard. However, this is not set up in the theme properly, so it is unusable... We looked into this and feel confident that directory links cannot be set through the plugin but that the plugin is vital to the site and cannot be removed.""","11/Dec/18 9:56 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Emily Maddox commented:_{color}

[jvalencia@highereducation.com](https://app.asana.com/0/933532928622344/list) can you please move them below: https://monosnap.com/file/WVZzLZJ8yg22vqKr53WIpL9xmnMlzm and expand to 3 listings?

THanks!

Quick question here: If we are moving on to Platform DLs here, do we want to remove the related ACF fields plus these items from the repo: 
https://github.com/HigherEducation/OnlineSchools.org/blob/master/web/wp-content/themes/osorg-theme/assets/src/scss/units/directory-links.scss
https://github.com/HigherEducation/OnlineSchools.org/blob/master/web/wp-content/themes/osorg-theme/functions/functions-directory-links.php

These are related to ACF custom fields for site-specific directory links. These are woven into the templates, so while none exist on the site today it is possible an author could add them in the future.

Note: This is different from Juan's comment above about the H-E plugin directory links. Those definitely do not work, but these ACF custom fields still do.","17/Dec/18 12:47 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_jvalencia@highereducation.com commented:_{color}

!image.png|thumbnail!",26/Nov/18 5:05 PM;dacosta;This issue requires your attention. [~mcomardo],"27/Nov/18 7:56 AM;dacosta;Hey Sam, so I checked out the programs and I'm pretty sure I know why they aren't showing up in the EL. Turns out no program snippets are available, and this would cause them to be filtered from the adblocks. 

So I added a program snippet to AS-Medical Assiting (https://edudirect.cmn.com/schools/38/programs/2473) now I've got to wait for cache and test again. 

Oh and the image you attached is for Medical Coding haha, I'd also like to know what site are you testing. 
Thanks Sam, I'll report back shortly.","27/Nov/18 8:59 AM;dacosta;Yeah, it was that. Now Keiser is showing up for Associate's>Medical Assisting. 
So basically if a program has an empty snippet field, it won't be considered for EL. 

Again, these programs will be far down the list because they're SEL, and not starred. After speaking with JLam, MOD rules can't fix SEL programs on an adblock, so if your intention is to make them appear on a site, manual placement might be the only way.",27/Nov/18 9:00 AM;dacosta;Please let me know if you need help with the snippets. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I discovered is we are reporting conversions but no associated clicks which leads me to believe that the tracking maybe off. All the instances are mapped to a redirect url that is not in Admin. I can't figure out where the breakage is happening. 

Steps I have taken:
Reviewed all programs to confirm correct url is in place. All is correct.
Reviewed cap bucket and setup correctly.

The last clicks with the doubleclick URL  were seen on Nov 18th, none since. I mentioned them because the image you attached was of OCT leads, and they were relevant for that month.

For Nov, so far the leads add up when comparing Admin and Metabase.  As for issues that I'm looking into for this month are:
Of 261 so far, I've found 13 duplicate leads, 4 triplicate and 1 lead that repeated five times.  I'll create a new ticket for these, and add you as a follower.

Guys, unfortunately even though the school has been removed/paused from admin, we need the forms for UoRockies to 404. There are old manual placements across the affiliate network that we cannot take down ourselves. The only way to assure that a user does not land on a Rockies form is to lead the form to an error page. 

From the school/client perspective, this task is not complete until that hackcollege form (and all other Rockies forms) leads the user to some kind of error page. That means that no user should ever ever be able to arrive at a form that has a Rockies logo on it. Crappy UX for the user, but that's what we have to do. 

bottomline: is it possible to get the HackCollege form to 404/error as a bandaid fix by EOD tomorrow?

Regarding this page: https://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/coding-training/

Section 2.07 no longer has a video, so we want to remove the play button from the image preview. We'd also like to remove the video runtime from the description on that page too. I already tried removing the <div class=""play-icon play-icon--preview single-video__preview""> element from the image, but that caused some text/image misalignment (see pinned image).

ORIGINAL TASK:

Video appears to be missing from page
https://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/intro-to-cpt/

-Can be seen under section 2.07 on page: https://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/coding-training/

Woohoo, I'm glad we checked! For what it's worth, there does seem to be residual video code in the backend (attached). I'm not sure if this should be removed? 

And I'm guessing we should remove 2.07's preview from that landing page, but I don't know how that'd look. I can remove it altogether, but it'd leave a jump from 2.06 to 2.08 and also get rid of the link to that page in general...","02/Nov/18 10:21 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Amy Tran commented:_{color}

However, When looking at *conversions* the `Apply Now` button counted and the `Request Info` didn't.

When pressing * Request Info *, the VIEW is registered on Metabase and after filling the form, a CONVERSION is seen on Metabase.

When pressing *APPLY NOW* a VIEW is sent to Metabase. However, while filling the forms there is an issue: The CONVERSION fires three times. I think it is because the application has several forms, so whenever it changes form, the CONVERSION fires again.

Hello [Dave Ashworth](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176849/list),

I believe this might be a bug: 
Ashford U is showing up in third place here https://forms.thebestcolleges.org/search?publisher=462 (when no DCS is selected).
However, no Ashford cap has TBC.org as a publisher. 

I must point out that at the beginning of the month 32 clicks were sent to a PAUSED cap (https://edudirect.cmn.com/schools/9/providers/390/caps/1069) this stopped happening so it was monitored and closed. I'm mentioning this because this cap does have TBC.org as a publisher.

The issue here is that general LO schools are not respecting placement restrictions (e.g. Ashford U isn't available for the publisher site). This causes the form to open but without any programs. This is a BUG , as the school shouldn't show up in the adblock. The good news is that a PR that solves this will be deployed shortly.

[Bristol Hagerman](https://app.asana.com/0/243275167691964/list) So at this point, we'd have to change this text for all schools or fo none.

Okay [TJ Quinn](https://app.asana.com/0/241489522126274/241489522126274) and I have an update here. 

We pushed back hard on the schools and ended up getting a slap on the wrist so, I guess we have to move forward with the changes. Not sure if we need to change all schools forms to the new language or if we can limit it to only CTU and AIU?

[Will Stern](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176813/222991954176813) is this something we can get a quick turnaround on? Sorry to push, but the schools have threatened to stop their campaigns with us.

[Doug Milnes](https://app.asana.com/0/722686611860614/list) Given our current layout and challenges with our homepage, I'm not in favor of adding adblocks to the homepage. At least, not yet.

Confirmed INTL traffic can see automated ad blocks.

According to [Emily Maddox](https://app.asana.com/0/106813058990697/list) the incomplete widget to EXCL was on a later date so the logic for that doesn't seem to be the source of hte issue.","12/Oct/18 1:41 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Justin Lam commented:_{color}

Chatting with [Will Stern](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176813/list) there's kind of 2 separate issues here.

• incomplete DCS widget submission direction to schools where not enabled (original task)
 - I do NOT see large volumes (or a relative spike) of INTL traffic to these schools thru widget so the INTL via ad blocks may be unrelated.
• intl traffic seeing ad blocks (added this chatter as I thought they'd be related - feel free to break out if not the case!)
 - Image to follow:  INTL platform driven Ad clicks - clearly weighted to our general promoted schools.","12/Oct/18 1:41 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

[Leonidez Acosta](https://app.asana.com/0/721627832894929/list) whenever your feature for general linkouts caps goes out, maybe check and see if these 2 issues are fixed by it?  I'm partly wondering if these are just more side affects that will be fixed by it.","12/Oct/18 2:32 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

[Dave@Cafeto](https://app.asana.com/0/623227981136756/list) maybe I'm reading it wrong, but I think the prior not in that task references manual ad blocks.  This issue is with automated ad blocks driving INTL clicks.","12/Oct/18 3:29 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

[Justin Lam](https://app.asana.com/0/224711320599358/list), maybe I'm the one confused haha. In that ticket I mentioned I was having problems with manual blocks, but there was also a script pasted on a site that I was seeing from South America.

[Dave@Cafeto](https://app.asana.com/0/623227981136756/list) Gotcha.  If the INTL for ""general"" editorial links is a known issue then we can disregard here.  The widget issue is still a concern tho.

After speaking with Dave, the issue here is that the school didn't have any marked states on the School Tab. I (incorrectly) assumed it worked like Caps where no marked items meant ALL the items. So yeah, my bad.

So I need to enable all states at school level not just cap buckets?","15/Oct/18 2:39 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Yes sir, and Publishers must also be set at School level.","15/Oct/18 3:25 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Confirmed - it's appearing in third place for BC.com.","15/Oct/18 4:48 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

I thought cap bucket was priority and school was basically ignored.","16/Oct/18 8:08 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Same here, but it turns out it has to be set in order to make schools appear for caps.","16/Oct/18 10:18 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

I adjusted the priorities of the caps and things appeared to being firing correctly.  As of Friday (10/5) there were only 31 leads in the CPL bucket and now 32.  Clearly not a HUGE issue, but wanting to confirm missed clicks are not being missed for CPC buckets.

So the CPL cap has 5 more publishers (thebestcolleges.org, matchcollege.com, learnhowtobecome.org, bestcollegesonline.com, & accounting.com) and 1 extra program (BA - Service Management) when compared to the CPC cap.
However, so far I checked all the leads since Oct 5 and none stands out on Metabase.

I'm going to give it a couple more days to see if anything increments.  I'm still curious ""how"" it ended up incrementing but too many fires to put out now to really invest any time at the moment.","15/Oct/18 9:03 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Hey guys,
Can I get a status update on this task? Did we find and fix the issue?","17/Oct/18 8:16 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

[Rich Dent](https://app.asana.com/0/266212838595954/list), there haven't been any leads sent to the CPL bucket. 
CPC is incrementing just fine.

I'm checking on this a couple of times a day.
This is still open to further investigate in case there's any new lead, but since reported, nothing new has shown up. If it continues working properly until Friday I guess it would be safe to close.","17/Oct/18 8:52 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

[TJ Quinn](https://app.asana.com/0/241489522126274/list) Alerted us yesterday to leads accruing for Ashford University. We flipped Ashford from a CPL to a CPC in October. We paused the CPL cap bucket but there are 32 leads attributed to the CPL cap bucket in Admin.

Yeah, Justin mentioned he had to adjust cap priorities for things to fire as intended. This task was open because there was one lead that went through to the CPL bucket. But since, everything's working appropriately.
If any other lead increases the bucket, I'll have to id it to check out if it's site or program related.","17/Oct/18 10:46 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

The cap bucket was not enabled so does priorities matter?","17/Oct/18 11:53 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

No, priorities of paused caps shouldn't matter, but it appeared to solve the first problem. That was strange and it's also why i'm following this cap since it was reported 🙂","26/Oct/18 10:33 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Closing this up. No new leads were sent to the Cap bucket in 15 days,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This one is tricky. It actually IS working as intended. But while digging to check the issue out I noticed that there is actually an issue with the priority arrangements on Admin. 
There are two priority tabs, one on the School dashboard and another one on the Caps dashboard. So by design, the one on the schools is the one that's being checked for these leads with unknown DCS.","05/Oct/18 12:49 PM;dacosta;I've attached an image of both priority settings:

I believe it is a bug, because after checking a out all the school/program/cap flags and configs, the only ""issue"" I can find is that the MSN program is not marked as preferred. HOWEVER, other programs that aren't marked as preferred are also showing up in ML.
I haven't had any luck contacting Will, so I'll double check everything before escalating it as a bug tomorrow. 
I'll keep you posted.

",04/Oct/18 9:04 AM;dacosta;This issue requires your attention. [~dacosta],"04/Oct/18 10:03 AM;dacosta;So re capping before escalating:

- Spring Arbor University is active.

- MSN program is enabled and DSA is active. The program isn't preferred, but it shouldn't be a problem since other SEL non-preferred programs are appearing in ML.

- Program is assigned to an Active cap.

I'm testing on GoGrad.org and the forms aren't following ML as expected.

Hello [Shilpa Shyam](https://app.asana.com/0/231159015628484/list), are there any more details?
I've been trying to replicate, but the only errors I'm seeing are not related to platform or HE.
Maybe it's browser related? What's the client's setup?","28/Sep/18 5:46 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Shilpa Shyam commented:_{color}

let me see if i can get more details, he didn't provide much and the UX is working so not sure exactly what he means either... i'll check back on this.","30/Sep/18 5:28 PM;dacosta;Hi there, we haven't heard from you in a while.

So basically, they did a bunch of site optimizations earlier this month and it dramatically impacted their leads (negatively, of course lol). They reverted the optimizations and it stabilized again.. Now they think there may be some residual affects from the optimization that is affecting leads through the Ad Block for SMU and Syracuse. 

[Dave@Cafeto](https://app.asana.com/0/623227981136756/list) do you by chance know how to submit test leads for EXCL forms? Wondering if for some reason leads aren't being reported correctly for those placements...","01/Oct/18 2:16 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

Let me check it out, 🙂","01/Oct/18 5:26 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Dave@Cafeto commented:_{color}

So the lead count has changed, decreased a bit. After speaking with Shilpa, it seems to be due to seasonality.
Tested anyways: Pixels are firing for all schools on the site, and the leads are appearing on Metabase as expected. Closing this up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I posted there too, but I'll copy below.  For context, in May we worked with Will & team to lower inelgibles in RN to BSN.  The intended functionality should be that users only see this subject if it is their first form OR they already indicated that they have an RN (and are thus eligible for this program).  We should see very few form 2+ ineligibles due to not having a RN liscense.



Posted in Asana: bringing this one back up -- TJ Quinn noticed that we're still seeing a a large number of forms 2+ inelgibles for Select in Rn to BSN (Grand Canyon is most affected, but Chamberlain and Herzing are also relatively affected).  Obviously forms 2+ ineligibles will still be possible to a degree if the user chooses to manually switch the program drop down, but assuming most users don't do that, my understanding is that we shouldn't be seeing this too often.

Happens when a user fills in the personal data without selecting program information. The Acode only populates when the last specialization program is selected(specialization = acode specific). I’ve added additional required checks to prevent a user from submission.

A good test would be to:
1. Clear Cache
2. Refresh Page

4. Try submitting.

I conducted a test where I logged in via VPN and tested what variable we pass for utm_source based on MD and CA. In both cases we passed the same variable. What was passed was based on what cap bucket was in first position. Need to get this fixed asap as it is throwing off tracking on school side and revenue on our end.

Hi there. Hoping we can get the reference to ""Clearwater"" on Ultimate Medical Academys ranking placement here: https://www.bestcolleges.com/features/top-pharmacy-technician-online-training-programs/

""Ultimate Medical Academy-Clearwater"" change to ""Ultimate Medical Academy""

The main paragraph for the school listing seems OK, so if we can just get Clearwater removed from the school name and location that would be great.

For the record:

If something needs to be changed in a rankings list, Amy Tran or someone on her team needs to make that change. They need to do that in their spreadsheets, otherwise the next time they upload it via WordPress, it will overwrite anything done directly in Algolia.

The write procedure is a one way process: from WordPress to Algolia. Algolia is display only on our sites; there is no writing happening from Algolia to any of our tools.

Here's a funny thing -- the location field seems to always display a comma no matter what. So changing the City, State to just say ""Online"" means it displays either as 

Online,

or

, Online

Leaving it blank means it just displays a comma (see screenshot). Any ideas on getting around this, [Jen G](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176861/list)?

This is done and live. The City field is always shown, but if you don't put in a state, the `, [state abbr]` will not show. So you can put ""Online"" in the ""city"" field if you want.

The page source is telling me that they are on the 2nd page of the big table database, but the ""Show More"" button isn't working for me so hard to confirm...

[Doug Milnes](https://app.asana.com/0/722686611860614/list) - how do you want these to be used in the near-term/long-term?

These are potential monetization opportunities our offshore team finds for us that we'll review occasionally.  This specific one is a good example because we ([Emily Maddox](https://app.asana.com/0/106813058990697/list) and I) took directory links off this page because we felt a better design was possible than what was up there before (2 small banners with school name/logo only)

Should these continue to get routed to me, to yourself, or would you like our offshore team to stop them altogether?

[Stephanie Snider](https://app.asana.com/0/223157124360929/list), is criminaljustice.com a seed site?  Feels like lots of opportunity to monetize whole site, what is the plan here?
","18/Sep/18 11:11 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Stephanie Snider commented:_{color}

It was a crusty old site for the longest time that was just relaunched using the seed site template. The only page of value before relaunch was https://www.criminaljustice.com/online-degrees/ and I believe that was mostly career traffic. We added 50 state pages and several, deeper DCS pages. We're just now moving into our marketing cycle. 

I'd like to wait to monetize the WHOLE site until we have an opportunity to earn links into the newer pages. I'll continue to monitor traffic to the new DCS pages. If we can wait until the end of the year and monetize going into January, that would be preferable.

[Doug Milnes](https://app.asana.com/0/722686611860614/list) in real numbers, the online master's page is doing about 400 visitors a month and the online bachelor's page is <100 per month.

 Shilpa and I have a meeting this morning to go through the pages I've identified for monetization for Criminaljustice.com - once we go through that, I'll add those confirmed pages here.

MoD is an automated monetization deployment system that Tech deploys so that monetization managers can add/edit/customize monetization on any page without needing any additional front-end work other than the initial setup.

Will keep posting any relevant findings. Right know is it possible that they moved the tracking pixel or are A/B testing a new form? [~mcomardo]","27/Aug/18 3:22 PM;dacosta;Update right here:

Spoke with Chad and tracking hasn't been modified.
In this moment JLam has paused Liberty U activity. Purdue is registering leads, both have increased at the same rate, so whatever caused the discrepancy might have been solved. Gonna continue monitoring both schools anyways.
I'm still seeing the same issues, not really sure who'd have to speak with Liberty about their form. Was gonna speak with RDent, but he's PTO.

I'm tagging all the mentioned above on Asana.","27/Aug/18 3:31 PM;dacosta;Updating:

LibertyDegrees.org is fixed. Sounds like there was a task to remove “Delay Processing Minutes” from the posting to Liberty API but the API would not accept that field missing. Should be able to unpause the campaign now.

",27/Aug/18 3:57 PM;dacosta;This issue requires your attention. [~dacosta],28/Aug/18 9:18 AM;dacosta;Liberty U & PUG are increasing as expected on both Admin and Metabase. No double pixel has been found on either TY page.,"28/Aug/18 12:21 PM;dacosta;Liberty continues to increase 1 & 1.



However, while monitoring, PUG incremented 3 leads in admin but only 2 in metabase.
Lead 153,609,940 from https://www.mastersprogramsguide.com/rankings/fastest-online-masters-degree-programs/
Lead  153,609,921 from https://nursejournal.org/bsn-degree/7-best-online-rn-to-bsn-programs/

Adding it as info, since I haven't been able to check the pixels on the  TY page, as it seems my VPN isn't working as expected because leadimport is always 0 after sending the info. (No conversion on Network tab). 

Escalating to Dev and assigning Will for when he comes back(per Mitch's request).
 ","28/Aug/18 3:48 PM;dacosta;I'm following this up with a couple of observations:

-Manually placed EL are not respecting Geo restrictions. I've been able to submit leads with my VPN switched off (they increase on cap bucket & metabase).

-I'm viewing different landing pages after clicking the same LO on https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/ (see landing pages 1&2) looks like there's an extra ""v4"" and only one of them has the referrer at the end of the URL.

-I found that conversion is inconsistent when verified on the Network tab on these sites (with or without VPN):

Can you please provide me with a status update here, and/or if i'm missing a new Asana on this, if you can please direct me that way.  🙂 . This issue keeps happening (in particular with Purdue) and campaigns cap out earlier than we are actually meeting their budgets.  Thank you so much for your help on this.","31/Oct/18 9:25 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

[Avishan Hodjat](https://app.asana.com/0/241489522126286/list) We've been digging into things, Liberty has correct tracking placed on the page and is almost exact - For Oct, Admin caps are 387, accepted deliveries to Liberty are 386 (as we've recorded)

All we've been able to verify at this point is that Purdue has the correct tracking placed...do we have a count for what Purdue has recorded for Oct 1 - <some point in Oct>?","31/Oct/18 10:22 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Avishan Hodjat commented:_{color}

let me know if this helps:","31/Oct/18 10:22 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

[Avishan Hodjat](https://app.asana.com/0/241489522126286/list) Do we know if the PUG counts are raw counts? Does it include Duplicate submits? I believe we exclude multiple submits within the same session.","31/Oct/18 10:27 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

By they way, my question is directed towards data in QV not Admin. The Admin counts and QV counts are off for many schools. Both EXCL CPC and EXCL CPL campaigns. I think there is another ticket in on this one already.","31/Oct/18 12:05 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

Thanks [Avishan Hodjat](https://app.asana.com/0/241489522126286/list)!  That helps a lot.  I'll see what we have that differs from that.","31/Oct/18 12:15 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

One more question, is Liberty reporting less than 387 for Oct?","31/Oct/18 2:04 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

[Rich Dent](https://app.asana.com/0/266212838595954/list) (if someone else, let me know),
Can we have Purdue use the latest-greatest conversion code?
<iframe height=""1"" width=""1"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://platform.highereducation.com/conversion""></iframe>

Assuming Purdue isn't running any A/B tests and putting multiple conversions on a page, that's about all we can see.  The success pages we've checked into all have just the one tracking pixel, so we can't see any problems so far.","31/Oct/18 2:09 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Rich Dent commented:_{color}

[Will Stern](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176813/list) I think there maybe something else at play here. I was telling Avi that we are seeing lead count discrepancies with several schools between what is in Admin and what is QV. I wasn't sure if maybe they are both pulling from different databases or something else but we typically see higher lead counts and clicks counts in Admin. The database is just a theory btw. I can ask CS team to provide specific examples of cap buckets that show vastly different totals than QV Performance Dashboard.","31/Oct/18 3:27 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

If QV counts are LOWER than Admin counts, then that's actually something we're aware of.  We can expect to see QV counts to be lower than Admin for EXCL CPL leads.  This is because mobile safari on iOS as of recent prevents cross-domain tracking and simply won't allow us to track conversions that happen on other sites.  We're discussing solutions, but for now there's no clear solution present.","31/Oct/18 3:42 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Avishan Hodjat commented:_{color}

As a Follow up to [Mitch Comardo](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176801/list) 's comment above -- Met with [Chad Donohue](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176825/list) to go over the the conversion ledger.    Will work with [Gus Santaella](https://app.asana.com/0/457845259542305/list) to evaluate when/if we will adopt this updated table into Qlik/Tableau (there is a relatively large effort associated with making this transition in terms of our data models).

That said, this is relatively independent from the effort to correct the Admin cap counters.  My understanding is that we've already made a lot of progress there (and thus cap counters should match closer to what we observe in Qlik). So regardless of whether/when we adopt this new data model, you should have less issues with early cap outs.","27/Dec/18 10:06 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Chad Donohue commented:_{color}

[Christian Jones](https://app.asana.com/0/224711320599370/list) the cap counters are incremented based on the ledger entries and not necessarily for `normalized_events` (The 2 things happen near the same time and could be fine, but the caps definitely increment based on a ledger entry being present and _not_ a normalized event entry)","01/Jan/19 5:30 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Mitch Comardo commented:_{color}

One of the things Dave's doing in [Actionable Discrepancy Improvements](https://app.asana.com/0/942457804343432/978795106249476/f) is to add de-duping into normalized events the way we have it for the new ledger, which should help with that.","21/Jan/19 3:59 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}

 So checking this issue out:

The QDF set on the desktop site seems to be a generic code (schools.collegedegrees.com). But it works and shows programs that are associated with the publisher.

The widget _does_ disappear when switching to the mobile version, although there's an option in the menu - 'Complete the Form' that I believe should show the widget. The problem is that the affiliate pasted an incomplete code. 

Overall, the page needs some work done, because there are html tags that can be seen among the text and sometimes on mobile, the desktop version sticks around until making a couple of clicks.

That being said, this site doesn't show up in the top 290+ (according to revenue). So just in case I'm going to put it in Shilpa's 'new' column as the issue has to do with monetization, but I'd figure this is low priority anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To remove a school from a page like: https://www.collegedegree.com/courses/business-programs:

  1. Log in to the backend: https://www.collegedegrees.com/admin/domain.php?action=view&id=22.
  2. Select the 'Program Data' tab.
  3. Find the matching program. This can be a wild guess given that many pages have same or similar names.
  4. Click on your guess, and check that the school you want to remove is featured there.
  5. Check ""Publish"" from yes/on to no/off and Save.
  6. Profit.

","17/Aug/18 7:16 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Jen G commented:_{color}

Removing schools from this site is a multi-step process.

I did the first part of this: I flipped the active flag in each of these schools' rows in the database to False.

The next step is where it starts getting tricky. These are all cached, static pages, and they have to be removed from the server so the web application can regenerate them (assuming the web application still works, of course). We don't have a good way to know which files have these schools in them and I don't know how slowly they have to be removed. The instructions say ""When deleting the files, be careful that you’re not giving the web server too many files to generate at once. Use caution when deleting these."" Hopefully that just sounds more ominous than it really is. 😆

I think this is where we get Matt involved to see how he thinks this could be accomplished and if the web application is likely to run again to regenerate the files.

I'll talk to him on Monday and get his opinion on this.

Thanks!

[Shilpa Shyam](https://app.asana.com/0/231159015628484/list): I think we will be able to remove these schools. At least, we will be able to remove pages (that should then be regenerated 🤞) with that exact wording.

There are 16886 unique files with those exact word combinations, so it will take some time to complete the removal since we have to remove them in batches or risk tipping the server over.

Let me know about ITT Tech - that school is all over this site and this is our big opportunity to remove it. I'll remove that if needed and then Matt can begin the process.

Thanks!

So the issue was that backend code was verifying the state before submitting the lead and going on to the next form. This was actually from a PR made on Monday. Since Liberty's form doesn't ask for a state to be submitted, the value was missing, therefore there were no leads since then.

Huge find! Thank you for reporting! The code was corrected by the backend team and the forms were tested to verify they're working again as expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attached 2 examples where Trident should have appeared in the multilead if the user marks that they have a military affiliation, as well as my lead string where I passed over them.  This investigation came from seeing that Trident Military was falling far behind their IO for military users (they've only generated a couple leads, should be generating more).  We have had some mixed results with this testing - at one point Trident showed in the multilead last afternoon, but as of this morning I am again not seeing them when submitting test leads.

Hypothesis -- despite being lower priority, their non-military cap bucket may somehow be interfering when it hits its daily cap, causing the military bucket to think it's capped out.

So it's definitely happening, Trident is being ignored sometimes. In this moment  Will Stern is checking a couple of things on backend, so I'll keep you posted.

Thank you for reporting! I'll get back to you as soon as the issue is identified.","09/Aug/18 3:37 PM;dacosta;So I'm going to have to escalate this ticket to Will. 
Locally and on Staging, Trident U _is_ being shown. But not on production. 
Multilead seems to be working just fine.  As for the bucket's non-military daily capacity, since the issue isn't being replicated outside of prod, it is hard to change the cap values to determine if it's the culprit.

OK, this is fixed now.

[Shilpa Shyam](https://app.asana.com/0/231159015628484/list) I've been working on this this morning but having some issues connecting with the database. I'm reaching out to Matt Scifo to try and get that cleared up.

Update: Still having issues connecting personally but [Jason Comes](https://app.asana.com/0/221880129404897/list) is able to connect so I was able to work with him to get this page taken down:

http://www.onlineeducation.net/school/sanford-brown-college-fenton

There's an issue with the website where the school is still appearing in this list. Be advised we're working on finding a solution for this:

https://monosnap.com/file/sHmvwpzaawFw4WKINKDotyIW6rIC1X

We're also planning to take down this page as it's another one David alerted me to:

http://www.onlineeducation.net/school/sanford-brown-college-saint-peters

However, there are several other instances of Sanford Brown appearing in the database (see attachment). [Shilpa Shyam](https://app.asana.com/0/231159015628484/list) could you confirm for us which to remove?
","07/Aug/18 11:21 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Shilpa Shyam commented:_{color}

Thanks for the update Brian!

Actually - all of these instances of Sanford-Brown should be removed.

[Shilpa Shyam](https://app.asana.com/0/231159015628484/list) the actual pages should all be taken down now. There are still several instances where Sanford Brown shows up across the website as a link - these links all should redirect back to the homepage now as the pages have been taken down. We're going to figure out a gameplan for actually removing those links now.

[Emily Maddox](https://app.asana.com/0/106813058990697/list) - you okay with me adding monetization to these pages? At least for August?
","30/Jul/18 5:01 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Emily Maddox commented:_{color}

Yes, need to get approval from [David Rubin](https://app.asana.com/0/223157124360941/list) for the homepage.
","30/Jul/18 5:01 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_David Rubin commented:_{color}

Have at it, [Sam Sok](https://app.asana.com/0/224711320599382/list). We removed the widget from the homepage at some point last year because it wasn't driving much revenue, FYI. But you know me, I'm all about the Benjamins, so if there's money to be made, let's monetize those bad boys!

I have no immediate promo plans.
","02/Aug/18 10:01 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Sam Sok commented:_{color}

Assigned to Mitch, (but most likely will be for [Eric Rasch](https://app.asana.com/0/221958638007097/list)), do we need Dev to add widgets to the pages? I tried to poke around to do so, but didn't see the option
","02/Aug/18 10:01 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Mitch Comardo commented:_{color}

Is this a blitz item?

[Amy Tran](https://app.asana.com/0/223201684503773/list) - Are you able to add widgets to these TBC pages? Guessing not since they are landing pages, but worth asking...
","02/Aug/18 10:06 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Sam Sok commented:_{color}

[Mitch Comardo](https://app.asana.com/0/222991954176801/list)- indeed it is! Part of a larger initiative to monetize further for August
","02/Aug/18 10:11 AM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Emily Maddox commented:_{color}

Tagged blitz.

Widgets re-added! And you hit ""Delete"" on this guy here to add the monetization back.

Nice! https://www.thebestcolleges.org/scholarships/ is defaulting to master's in special education. Are we able to remove those defaults? I know it uses some kid of logic based on the URL.

I just updated that [David Rubin](https://app.asana.com/0/223157124360941/list). Thanks for pointing out - will probably take a few hours to update.

[~mcomardo],"03/Jul/18 10:08 AM;dacosta;Hello [~qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5b106baf93816854030df97a]

I've been digging and for the Platform WO tool I'm getting these results:

-For Case 1:
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
I'm seeing SNHU as expected

-For Case 2:
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 
I'm indeed getting a coinflip. Walden in this screenshot, but I've also been shown Regent U. For this case Capella U is consistently shown if the URL field is blank.

-For Case 3:
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 
I'm being shown U of Phoenix. However, the rules for this combo seem to conflict.
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
SNHU is first for Rule 1 vs SNHU is blocked for Rule 2.

I've done other tests with a PIT copy I made mid-June and other combos seem to work fine.
I'd like you to provide more information on how you're testing the cases. ","03/Jul/18 11:05 AM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5b106baf93816854030df97a;Hey Dave -- for case 1, Sam, Justin and I are all still getting Ashford.  We're also using the Platform WO tool to test these cases

That case aside, do you then agree that cases 2 & 3 are not functioning as expected?  

Case 2 should not be a coinflip as the rules specify Capella and Walden in the Pin (2 schools pinned above Capella, but neither are available)

And for case 3, agreed that the rules conflict, however our understanding is that only the highest priority (lowest priority value) rule gets evaluated per user -- that is, the block in rule 2 should not even be evaluated as only rule 3 should even be in scope.  Perhaps we're understanding how the PIT rules work differently than how they actually work?

Agreed that the PIT is working in most cases, but I was verifying that some recent changes I implemented a week ago, and when doing so found these 3 scenarios that I could not explain.  Do want to understand if these are functioning incorrectly or if we should be using the tool differently than we are.

attached an image for each of these 3.

!image.png|thumbnail!","03/Jul/18 11:48 AM;dacosta;So initially - just in case, because it hasn't been mentioned- clear cache for platform and retry case 1, so we can confirm it is showing something different for you (Mitch and Will are also seeing SNHU).

Case 2 is working for Will, but I'm definitely seeing a coinflip - so this is not working as intended.

For case 3, you are right about the lowest priority number prevailing over other rules. However, I spoke with Dave Ashworth and it seems that if a school is blocked in any rule, it's blocked for all rules (this is to avoid having to block the school for every new rule).  So in this case it should show Walden, as it's the second school after SNHU in rule #3. I'm seeing Phoenix, so It isn't working properly either, because the same rules should apply for everyone. 

I'll add Will and Dave to the ticket for any input ,or to point out anything I might have overlooked.

Dave, the Ashford recommendation from the rule you referenced below comes specifically for Texas -- if you select any other geo (I think you have no state selected) it should recommend SNHU I believe (via rule 3 below, priority 4)","03/Jul/18 4:40 PM;dacosta;I _am_ seeing the rule [~qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5b106baf93816854030df97a] is mentioning.

Thanks a ton for your work on this.  I feel a guilty burden now seeing that you sent that at 11PM!  Really appreciate the effort that went into this

Noted that a school block will apply to all users who fit the matching criteria (whether or not the rule is top priority).  Totally makes sense why it is set up that way, I think it just confused us because we were operating under the assumption of ""only 1 rule ever applies to a user"" -- but we can definitely work with this.

Thanks again Dave & David!","05/Jul/18 8:30 AM;qm:6fc3e611-5401-48ac-b2fa-b8a969f39e7c:5b106baf93816854030df97a;and meant to say in that last comment -- i tested case 1 & 2 again and they are now working as I would expect them to.  3, per the below sounds like it was more a case of me misunderstanding the intended functionality.",05/Jul/18 8:50 AM;dacosta;Happy to help.

So I was troubleshooting this and the pixel is firing and I'm seeing the lead captured on Admin and Metabase.
I spoke with Chad and Dave, it turns out there's something that needs to be replaced in Backend. This task will be handled with a new hire on their team.
The good news is that the ""."" won't affect anything on H-E's side.

So I'm escalating this and tagging Will meanwhile. ","26/Jun/18 3:16 PM;syncbot;➤ {color:#999999}_Will Stern commented:_{color}
